# Serendipity
_Math.random() for the rest of us._

Serendipity is a javascript library that generates custom random numbers.

Note that this currently just uses Math.random() for psuedo-random generation. If you need closer to true random, there are plenty and plenty of libraries made by people who know their stuff far better. ðŸ˜‰ This was created because I was stick of creating the same random function over and over again.

## Installation

- Install by running ```npm install --save-dev @cspruit/serendipity``` in the same directory as the package.json file lives.

## Usage
### Random
- Generates a random number based off of Math.random
    - max : number - optional - Max range, exclusive.
    - min : number - optional - Min range, inclusive
    - useFractions - optional - Unless this is true, will return an integer

```javascript
import {random} from '@cspruit/serendipity';

const randNormal = random(); // Returns 0-1, like Math.random()
const randMax = random(5); // Returns 0-4
const randMin = random(5, 1); // Returns 1-4
const randFloat = random(5, 1, true); // Returns a float from 1-4
```
